## 🚀 What is AutoRound?

AutoRound is an advanced quantization library designed for Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). 
It delivers high accuracy at ultra-low bit widths (2–4 bits) with minimal tuning by leveraging sign-gradient descent and offering broad hardware compatibility. 
For more details, see our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.05516) for more details and explore quantized models available on several Hugging Face Spaces, e.g. [Intel](https://huggingface.co/Intel), [OPEA](https://huggingface.co/OPEA),  [Kaitchup](https://huggingface.co/kaitchup)
and [fbaldassarri](https://huggingface.co/fbaldassarri). For usage instructions, please refer to  [User Guide](./docs/step_by_step.md).

## 🆕 What's New

[2025/09] AutoRound now includes experimental support for the mxfp4 and nvfp4 dtypes. For accuracy results, see the [documentation](./docs/mxnv_acc.md)
. We currently recommend exporting to the LLM-Compressor format.

[2025/08] AutoRound now provides experimental support for an improved INT2 algorithm via `--enable_alg_ext`. See this [documentation](./docs/alg_202508.md)
 for some accuracy results. 

[2025/07] AutoRound now offers experimental support for **GGUF** format, and recommends using optimized RTN mode (--iters 0) for
  all bits other than 3 bits. Example
  models: [Intel/Qwen3-235B-A22B-q2ks-mixed-AutoRound](https://huggingface.co/Intel/Qwen3-235B-A22B-q2ks-mixed-AutoRound)
  and [Intel/DeepSeek-R1-0528-q2ks-mixed-AutoRound](https://huggingface.co/Intel/DeepSeek-R1-0528-q2ks-mixed-AutoRound). **A more advanced algorithm** tailored for specific configurations may be available in
  v0.7.1.

[2025/05] AutoRound has been integrated into **vLLM**. You can now run models in the AutoRound format directly with
  vLLM versions later than v0.85.post1.

[2025/04] AutoRound has been integrated into **Transformers**. You can run models in the AutoRound format directly
  with Transformers versions later than 4.51.3.

[2025/03] The INT2-mixed **DeepSeek-R1** model (~200GB) retains 97.9% accuracy. Check
  out [OPEA/DeepSeek-R1-int2-mixed-sym-inc](https://huggingface.co/OPEA/DeepSeek-R1-int2-mixed-sym-inc).

## Model Quantization (CPU/Intel GPU/Gaudi/CUDA)

### CLI Usage
Please change to `auto-round-mllm` for visual-language models (VLMs) quantization. The full list of supported arguments is provided by calling `auto-round -h` on the terminal.

```bash
auto-round \
    --model Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B \
    --scheme "W4A16" \
    --format "auto_round" \
    --output_dir ./tmp_autoround
```

We offer another two recipes, `auto-round-best` and `auto-round-light`, designed for optimal accuracy and improved speed, respectively. Details are as follows.
<details>
  <summary>Other Recipes</summary>

  ```bash
# Best accuracy, 3X slower, low_gpu_mem_usage could save ~20G but ~30% slower
auto-round-best \
    --model Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B \
    --scheme "W4A16" \
    --low_gpu_mem_usage 
  ```

  ```bash
# 2-3X speedup, slight accuracy drop at W4 and larger accuracy drop at W2
auto-round-light \
    --model Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B \
    --scheme "W4A16" 

  ```

  <!-- ```bash
auto-round-fast \
# Fast and low memory, 2-3X speedup, slight accuracy drop at W4G128
    --model Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B \
    --bits 4 \
    --group_size 128 \
  ``` -->

</details>

In conclusion, we recommend using **auto-round for W4A16 and auto-round-best with `enable_alg_ext` for W2A16**. However, you may adjust the
configuration to suit your specific requirements and available resources.

### API Usage

```python
from auto_round import AutoRound

# Load a model (supports FP8/BF16/FP16/FP32)
model_name_or_path = "Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B"

# Available schemes: "W2A16", "W3A16", "W4A16", "W8A16", "NVFP4", "MXFP4" (no real kernels), "GGUF:Q4_K_M", etc.
ar = AutoRound(model_name_or_path, scheme="W4A16")

# Highest accuracy (4–5× slower).
# `low_gpu_mem_usage=True` saves ~20GB VRAM but runs ~30% slower.
# ar = AutoRound(model_name_or_path, nsamples=512, iters=1000, low_gpu_mem_usage=True)

# Faster quantization (2–3× speedup) with slight accuracy drop at W4G128.
# ar = AutoRound(model_name_or_path, nsamples=128, iters=50, lr=5e-3)

# Supported formats: "auto_round" (default), "auto_gptq", "auto_awq", "llm_compressor", "gguf:q4_k_m", etc.
ar.quantize_and_save(output_dir="./tmp_autoround", format="auto_round")

### API Usage for VLMs

If you encounter issues during quantization, try setting iters=0 (to enable RTN) and use group_size=32 for better
results.


<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>

**This feature is experimental and may be subject to changes**.

By default, AutoRoundMLLM only quantize the text module of VLMs and uses `NeelNanda/pile-10k` for calibration. To
quantize the entire model, you can enable `quant_nontext_module` by setting it to True, though support for this feature
is limited. For more information, please refer to the AutoRoundMLLM [readme](./auto_round/mllm/README.md).

```python
from auto_round import AutoRoundMLLM

# Load the model
model_name_or_path = "Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct"
# Quantize the model
ar = AutoRoundMLLM(model_name_or_path, scheme="W4A16")
output_dir = "./tmp_autoround"
ar.quantize_and_save(output_dir)
```

</details>



## Model Inference

### vLLM (CPU/Intel GPU/CUDA)
Please note that support for the MoE models and visual language models is currently limited.
```python
from vllm import LLM, SamplingParams

prompts = [
    "Hello, my name is",
]
sampling_params = SamplingParams(temperature=0.6, top_p=0.95)
model_name = "Intel/DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B-int4-AutoRound"
llm = LLM(model=model_name)

outputs = llm.generate(prompts, sampling_params)

for output in outputs:
    prompt = output.prompt
    generated_text = output.outputs[0].text
    print(f"Prompt: {prompt!r}, Generated text: {generated_text!r}")
```

### Transformers (CPU/Intel GPU/Gaudi/CUDA)


AutoRound support 10+ backends and automatically selects the best available backend based on the installed libraries and prompts the user to
install additional libraries when a better backend is found.

**Please avoid manually moving the quantized model to a different device** (e.g., model.to('cpu')) during inference, as
this may cause unexpected exceptions.

The support for Gaudi device is limited.
```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "Intel/DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B-int4-AutoRound"
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, device_map="auto", torch_dtype="auto")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
text = "There is a girl who likes adventure,"
inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)
print(tokenizer.decode(model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=50)[0]))
```
