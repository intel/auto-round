## 🚀 What is AutoRound?

AutoRound is an advanced quantization library designed for Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). It delivers high accuracy at ultra-low bit widths (2–4 bits) with minimal tuning by leveraging sign-gradient descent and offering broad hardware compatibility. Check out our paper on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.05516) for more details and quantized models in several
Hugging Face Spaces,
e.g. [Intel](https://huggingface.co/Intel), [OPEA](https://huggingface.co/OPEA),  [Kaitchup](https://huggingface.co/kaitchup)
and [fbaldassarri](https://huggingface.co/fbaldassarri).

## 🆕 What's New

[2025/08] AutoRound now provides experimental support for an improved INT2 algorithm via `--enable_alg_ext`. See this [documentation](./docs/alg_202508.md)
 for some accuracy results. 

[2025/07] AutoRound now offers experimental support for **GGUF** format, and recommends using optimized RTN mode (--iters 0) for
  all bits other than 3 bits. Example
  models: [Intel/Qwen3-235B-A22B-q2ks-mixed-ar](https://huggingface.co/Intel/Qwen3-235B-A22B-q2ks-ar)
  and [Intel/DeepSeek-R1-0528-q2ks-mixed-ar](https://huggingface.co/Intel/DeepSeek-R1-0528-q2ks-mixed-ar). **A more advanced algorithm** tailored for specific configurations may be available in
  v0.6.1.

[2025/05] AutoRound provides some recipes for **DeepSeek-R1-0528**, please refer
  to [Intel/DeepSeek-R1-0528-int2-mixed-ar](https://huggingface.co/Intel/DeepSeek-R1-0528-int2-mixed-ar), [Intel/DeepSeek-R1-0528-int4-ar](https://huggingface.co/Intel/DeepSeek-R1-0528-int4-ar)
  and [Intel/DeepSeek-R1-0528-int4-asym-ar](https://huggingface.co/Intel/DeepSeek-R1-0528-int4-asym-ar) for
  more details.

[2025/05] AutoRound has been integrated into **vLLM**. You can now run models in the AutoRound format directly with
  vLLM versions later than v0.85.post1.

[2025/04] AutoRound has been integrated into **Transformers**. You can run models in the AutoRound format directly
  with Transformers versions later than 4.51.3.

[2025/03] The INT2-mixed **DeepSeek-R1** model (~200GB) retains 97.9% accuracy. Check
  out [OPEA/DeepSeek-R1-int2-mixed-sym-inc](https://huggingface.co/OPEA/DeepSeek-R1-int2-mixed-sym-inc).

### Command Line Usage
Please change to `auto-round-mllm` for visual-language models (VLMs) quantization. The full list of supported arguments is provided by calling `auto-round -h` on the terminal.

```bash
auto-round \
    --model Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B \
    --bits 4 \
    --group_size 128 \
    --format "auto_gptq,auto_awq,auto_round" \
    --output_dir ./tmp_autoround
```

We offer another two configurations, `auto-round-best` and `auto-round-light`, designed for optimal accuracy and improved speed, respectively. Details are as follows.
<details>
  <summary>Other Recipes</summary>

  ```bash
## best accuracy, 3X slower, low_gpu_mem_usage could save ~20G but ~30% slower
auto-round-best \
    --model Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B \
    --bits 4 \
    --group_size 128 \
    --low_gpu_mem_usage 
  ```

  ```bash
## light accuracy, 2-3X speedup, slight accuracy drop at W4 and larger accuracy drop at W2
auto-round-light \
    --model Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B \
    --bits 4 \
    --group_size 128 \

  ```

  <!-- ```bash
auto-round-fast \
## fast and low memory, 2-3X speedup, slight accuracy drop at W4G128
    --model Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B \
    --bits 4 \
    --group_size 128 \
  ``` -->

</details>

In conclusion, we recommend using **auto-round for INT4 and auto-round-best for INT2**. However, you may adjust the
configuration to suit your specific requirements and available resources.

### API Usage for VLMs

If you encounter issues during quantization, try setting iters=0 (to enable RTN) and use group_size=32 for better
results.

  <summary>Click to expand</summary>

**This feature is experimental and may be subject to changes**.

By default, AutoRoundMLLM only quantize the text module of VLMs and uses `NeelNanda/pile-10k` for calibration. To
quantize the entire model, you can enable `quant_nontext_module` by setting it to True, though support for this feature
is limited. For more information, please refer to the AutoRoundMLLM [readme](./auto_round/mllm/README.md).

```python
from auto_round import AutoRoundMLLM
from transformers import Qwen2VLForConditionalGeneration, AutoProcessor, AutoTokenizer

## load the model
model_name = "Qwen/Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct"
model = Qwen2VLForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_name, trust_remote_code=True, torch_dtype="auto")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_name, trust_remote_code=True)

## quantize the model
bits, group_size, sym = 4, 128, True
autoround = AutoRoundMLLM(model, tokenizer, processor, bits=bits, group_size=group_size, sym=sym)
autoround.quantize()

# save the quantized model, set format='auto_gptq' or 'auto_awq' to use other formats
output_dir = "./tmp_autoround"
autoround.save_quantized(output_dir, format="auto_round", inplace=True)
```

</details>



## Model Inference

### vLLM (CPU/Intel GPU/CUDA)
Please note that support for the MoE models and visual language models is currently limited.
```python
from vllm import LLM, SamplingParams

prompts = [
    "Hello, my name is",
]
sampling_params = SamplingParams(temperature=0.6, top_p=0.95)
model_name = "Intel/DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B-int4-AutoRound"
llm = LLM(model=model_name)

outputs = llm.generate(prompts, sampling_params)

for output in outputs:
    prompt = output.prompt
    generated_text = output.outputs[0].text
    print(f"Prompt: {prompt!r}, Generated text: {generated_text!r}")
```

### Transformers (CPU/Intel GPU/Gaudi/CUDA)


AutoRound support 10+ backends and automatically selects the best available backend based on the installed libraries and prompts the user to
install additional libraries when a better backend is found.

**Please avoid manually moving the quantized model to a different device** (e.g., model.to('cpu')) during inference, as
this may cause unexpected exceptions.

The support for Gaudi device is limited.
```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "Intel/DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B-int4-AutoRound"
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, device_map="auto", torch_dtype="auto")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
text = "There is a girl who likes adventure,"
inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)
print(tokenizer.decode(model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=50)[0]))
```
