## Model Details

This model is an int4 model with group_size 128 and symmetric quantization of [Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct) generated by [intel/auto-round](https://github.com/intel/auto-round).  

## How To Use

### INT4 Inference(CPU/HPU/CUDA)

CPU/ CUDA requires auto-round version>0.3.1

```python
from auto_round import AutoRoundConfig  ##must import for auto-round format
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

quantized_model_dir = "Intel/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-int4-inc"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(quantized_model_dir)

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    quantized_model_dir,
    torch_dtype="auto",
    device_map="auto",
)

##import habana_frameworks.torch.core as htcore ## uncommnet it for HPU
##import habana_frameworks.torch.hpu as hthpu ## uncommnet it for HPU
##model = model.to(torch.bfloat16).to("hpu") ## uncommnet it for HPU

prompt = "There is a girl who likes adventure,"
messages = [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": prompt}]

text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True)
model_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)

generated_ids = model.generate(
    model_inputs.input_ids,
    max_new_tokens=200,  ##change this to align with the official usage
    do_sample=False,  ##change this to align with the official usage
)
generated_ids = [output_ids[len(input_ids) :] for input_ids, output_ids in zip(model_inputs.input_ids, generated_ids)]

response = tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]
print(response)

prompt = "There is a girl who likes adventure,"
##INT4:
"""It sounds like you're starting to tell a story! Would you like me to help you continue it? Here's one possible continuation:

There is a girl who loves adventure. Her name is Lily and she has always been drawn to the unknown. From a young age, she would spend hours exploring the woods behind her house, imagining herself as a brave explorer discovering new lands. As she grew older, her thirst for adventure only intensified. She began traveling the world, seeking out thrilling experiences and pushing herself out of her comfort zone at every turn.

Is there anything specific you had in mind for this character or story? I'd be happy to help develop it further if you have any ideas!"""

##BF16:
"""That sounds exciting! What would you like to know or do regarding this girl who loves adventure? Perhaps you're looking for ideas on activities she might enjoy or ways to support her adventurous spirit. Let me know how I can assist you further!"""

prompt = "9.11和9.8哪个数字大"
# INT4:


##BF16:
"""要比较两个数字的大小，我们可以从左到右逐位进行比较。

首先，我们看整数部分：
- 9.11 的整数部分是 9。
- 9.8 的整数部分也是 9。

因为它们的整数部分相同，我们需要比较小数部分：
- 9.11 的小数部分是 0.11。
- 9.8 的小数部分是 0.8。

接下来，我们比较小数部分的第一位：
- 0.11 的第一位是 1。
- 0.8 的第一位是 8。

显然，8 比 1 大。因此，0.8 比 0.11 大。

所以，9.8 比 9.11 大。"""


prompt = "Once upon a time,"
##INT4:


##BF16:
"""Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a small village nestled between rolling hills and dense forests. The villagers lived simple lives, farming the land and tending to their livestock. They were a close-knit community, always ready to help one another in times of need.

In the heart of this village stood an ancient oak tree, under which the elders would gather to share stories and make important decisions for the community. Among these tales were whispers of a hidden treasure, said to be guarded by a mythical creature deep within the forest.

One day, a young girl named Elara overheard these whispers while fetching water from the well. Her curiosity piqued, she decided to embark on a quest to uncover the truth behind the legend. With nothing but her wits, a small backpack, and a map drawn by the village cartographer, Elara set off into the unknown.

As she ventured deeper into the forest, she encountered various challenges and made unexpected friends along

prompt = "请简短介绍一下阿里巴巴公司"
##INT4:

##BF16:
"""阿里巴巴集团是一家中国跨国科技公司，成立于1999年，总部位于中国杭州。该公司以B2B电子商务平台起家，现已发展成为涵盖零售、金融、物流、云计算等多个领域的综合性企业集团。旗下拥有淘宝、天猫、阿里云等知名业务，是全球最大的电子商务和零售平台之一。阿里巴巴致力于通过技术创新和商业生态系统建设，推动数字经济的发展，并为消费者和企业提供优质的产品与服务。

### Generate the model

Here is the sample command to generate the model. 

For symmetric quantization, we found overflow/NAN will occur for some backends, so better fallback some layers. auto_round requires version > 0.3.1

```bash
auto-round \
--model  Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct \
--device 0 \
--group_size 128 \
--nsamples 512 \
--bits 4 \
--iter 1000 \
--disable_eval \
--fp_layers "model.layers.5.mlp.down_proj,model.layers.5.mlp.up_proj,model.layers.5.mlp.gate_proj" \
--model_dtype "fp16" \
--format 'auto_round' \
--output_dir "./tmp_autoround" 
```

Asym

```bash
auto-round \
--model  Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct \
--device 0 \
--group_size 128 \
--nsamples 512 \
--bits 4 \
--iter 1000 \
--disable_eval \
--asym
--model_dtype "fp16" \
--format 'auto_round' \
--output_dir "./tmp_autoround" 
```

## Ethical Considerations and Limitations

The model can produce factually incorrect output, and should not be relied on to produce factually accurate information. Because of the limitations of the pretrained model and the finetuning datasets, it is possible that this model could generate lewd, biased or otherwise offensive outputs.

Therefore, before deploying any applications of the model, developers should perform safety testing.

## Caveats and Recommendations

Users (both direct and downstream) should be made aware of the risks, biases and limitations of the model.
