## Model Details

This model is an int4 model with group_size 128 and symmetric quantization of [Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct) generated by [intel/auto-round](https://github.com/intel/auto-round).  Load the model with `revision="5a6d912"` to use AutoGPTQ format

## How To Use

### INT4 Inference(CPU/HPU/CUDA)

CPU requires auto-round version>0.3.1

```python
from auto_round import AutoRoundConfig  ##must import for auto-round format
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

quantized_model_dir = "Intel/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-int4-inc"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(quantized_model_dir)

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    quantized_model_dir,
    torch_dtype="auto",
    device_map="auto",
    ##revision="0b70f95" ##AutoGPTQ format
    ##revision="5a6d912" ##Quantized lm-head version
)

##import habana_frameworks.torch.core as htcore ## uncommnet it for HPU
##import habana_frameworks.torch.hpu as hthpu ## uncommnet it for HPU
##model = model.to(torch.bfloat16).to("hpu") ## uncommnet it for HPU

prompt = "There is a girl who likes adventure,"
messages = [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": prompt}]

text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True)
model_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)

generated_ids = model.generate(
    model_inputs.input_ids,
    max_new_tokens=200,  ##change this to align with the official usage
    do_sample=False,  ##change this to align with the official usage
)
generated_ids = [output_ids[len(input_ids) :] for input_ids, output_ids in zip(model_inputs.input_ids, generated_ids)]

response = tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]
print(response)

prompt = "There is a girl who likes adventure,"
##INT4:
"""That's great! It sounds like this girl has an exciting spirit. How can I help you explore her love for adventure? Are you looking for ideas for adventurous activities, planning a trip, or perhaps looking for ways to support her adventurous nature?

##BF16:
"""That sounds exciting! What kind of adventures does she enjoy? Is there something specific you'd like to plan or discuss related to her love for adventure?

prompt = "9.11和9.8哪个数字大"
# INT4:
"""在比较9.11和9.8时，我们从左到右逐位进行比较：

1. 首先比较整数部分：两个数的整数部分都是9，相等。
2. 接下来比较小数部分：
   - 9.11的小数部分是0.11
   - 9.8的小数部分是0.8

将0.11和0.8进行比较，显然0.8大于0.11。

因此，9.8比9.11大。
"""

##BF16:
"""在比较9.11和9.8这两个数字时，我们可以直接进行比较：

- 9.11 是九点一一
- 9.8 是九点八

显然，9.8 比 9.11 大。这是因为9.8中的十分位是8，而9.11中的十分位是1，8大于1。

所以，9.8 > 9.11。"""

##INT4:
"""Once upon a time, in a land filled with wonder and magic, there lived a young girl named Elara. She had bright eyes that sparkled like the stars on a clear night and hair as golden as the sun-kissed fields of wheat. Elara's home was a cozy cottage nestled at the edge of a vast, enchanted forest, where ancient trees whispered secrets to one another and mystical creatures roamed freely.

Every day, Elara would venture into the forest, exploring its hidden paths and marveling at the wonders it held. One sunny morning, as she wandered deeper into the woods than ever before, she stumbled upon a glade bathed in a soft, ethereal light. In the center of this glade stood an enormous tree, its trunk wider than any building Elara had ever seen, and its branches stretching high into the sky.

As she approached the tree, she noticed a small, shimmering door carved into its bark. Curious, Elara reached out and"""

### Generate the model

Here is the sample command to generate the model. 

```bash
auto-round \
--model  Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct \
--device 0 \
--group_size 128 \
--nsamples 512 \
--bits 4 \
--iter 1000 \
--disable_eval \
--model_dtype "fp16" \
--format 'auto_gptq,auto_round' \
--output_dir "./tmp_autoround" 
```

## Ethical Considerations and Limitations

The model can produce factually incorrect output, and should not be relied on to produce factually accurate information. Because of the limitations of the pretrained model and the finetuning datasets, it is possible that this model could generate lewd, biased or otherwise offensive outputs.

Therefore, before deploying any applications of the model, developers should perform safety testing.

## Caveats and Recommendations

Users (both direct and downstream) should be made aware of the risks, biases and limitations of the model.
