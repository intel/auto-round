## Model Details

This model is an int4 model with group_size 128 and symmetric quantization of [Qwen/Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct) generated by [intel/auto-round](https://github.com/intel/auto-round). Load the model with `revision="f86a564"` to use AutoGPTQ format.

## How To Use

### INT4 Inference(CPU/HPU/CUDA)

CPU requires auto-round version>0.3.1

```python
from auto_round import AutoRoundConfig ##must import for auto-round format
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM,AutoTokenizer
quantized_model_dir = "Intel/Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct-int4-inc"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(quantized_model_dir)

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    quantized_model_dir,
    torch_dtype='auto',
    device_map="auto",
    ##revision="f86a564" ##AutoGPTQ format
)

##import habana_frameworks.torch.core as htcore ## uncommnet it for HPU
##import habana_frameworks.torch.hpu as hthpu ## uncommnet it for HPU
##model = model.to(torch.bfloat16).to("hpu") ## uncommnet it for HPU

prompt = "There is a girl who likes adventure,"
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
]

text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    tokenize=False,
    add_generation_prompt=True
)
model_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)

generated_ids = model.generate(
    model_inputs.input_ids,
    max_new_tokens=200,  ##change this to align with the official usage
    do_sample=False  ##change this to align with the official usage
)
generated_ids = [
output_ids[len(input_ids):] for input_ids, output_ids in zip(model_inputs.input_ids, generated_ids)
]

response = tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]
print(response)

prompt = "There is a girl who likes adventure,"
##INT4:
""" and she wants to go on a trip. She has 10 different types of snacks, and she can only carry 4 of them in her bag. How many different combinations of snacks can she choose from? To determine the number of different combinations of snacks the girl can choose from, we need to calculate the number of ways to choose 4 snacks out of 10. This is a classic combination problem where the order of selection does not matter.

The formula for combinations is given by:
\[
\binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
\]
where \( n \) is the total number of items to choose from, \( r \) is the number of items to choose, and \( ! \) denotes factorial.

In this problem, \( n = 10 \) and \( r = 4 \). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:
\[
\binom{10}{4}"""

""" and she has a hobby of collecting rocks. She wants to go on a trip to collect some unique rocks. She plans to visit three different locations: a mountain, a beach, and a desert. Each location has its own set of challenges and opportunities for rock collecting.

1. The mountain is known for its rare mineral deposits, but the terrain is steep and rocky, making it difficult to navigate.
2. The beach offers a variety of sedimentary rocks and fossils, but the tides can be unpredictable and dangerous.
3. The desert provides an opportunity to find petrified wood and volcanic rocks, but the heat and lack of water can be challenging.

The girl has a backpack that can carry up to 10 kilograms of rocks. She also has a map that shows the locations of specific types of rocks at each site. Her goal is to maximize the number of unique rock types she collects while staying within her weight limit.

Given the following information:

prompt = "9.11和9.8哪个数字大"  
#INT4: 
"""？ 9.11 比 9.8 大。

为了比较这两个数，我们可以从它们的小数部分开始：

- 9.11 可以看作是 9 + 0.11
- 9.8 可以看作是 9 + 0.8

由于 0.11 小于 0.8，所以 9.11 小于 9.8。因此，9.8 比 9.11 大。

总结：9.8 > 9.11。所以，9.8 是较大的数字。如果你的问题是问哪个数字较大，则答案是 9.8。如果问题是问哪个数字较小，则答案是 9.11。请确认你的问题需求。根据你的描述，9.8 是较大的数字。 

希望这能帮助你！如有其他问题，请随时提问。 

（注意：在"""

##BF16: 
"""？ 9.11 比 9.8 大。

在比较两个小数时，我们从左到右逐位进行比较。首先比较整数部分，如果相同，则比较小数部分。对于9.11 和 9.8：

- 整数部分都是9，相等。
- 比较小数部分：0.11 和 0.8。

由于0.11 < 0.8，所以9.11 < 9.8。

因此，9.8 比 9.11 大。 

所以，正确的答案是：9.8 比 9.11 大。 

希望这能帮助你理解！如果你有其他问题，请随时告诉我。 

总结：9.8 > 9.11。 

希望这个解释清楚了你的疑问。如果有任何进一步的问题或需要更多帮助，请告诉我！

The old man decided to test John's character by giving him a bag of gold coins and telling him to distribute it among the villagers. John was overjoyed at first but then realized that he could use the money for himself. However, he remembered the wise man's words and distributed the coins equally among the villagers. The wise man was pleased with John's actions and revealed himself as a fairy godfather.

### Generate the model

Here is the sample command to generate  the model. 

```bash
auto-round \
--model  Qwen/Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct \
--device 0 \
--group_size 128 \
--nsamples 512 \
--bits 4 \
--iter 1000 \
--disable_eval \
--model_dtype "fp16" \
--format 'auto_gptq,auto_round' \
--output_dir "./tmp_autoround" 
```

## Ethical Considerations and Limitations

The model can produce factually incorrect output, and should not be relied on to produce factually accurate information. Because of the limitations of the pretrained model and the finetuning datasets, it is possible that this model could generate lewd, biased or otherwise offensive outputs.

Therefore, before deploying any applications of the model, developers should perform safety testing.

## Caveats and Recommendations

Users (both direct and downstream) should be made aware of the risks, biases and limitations of the model.
