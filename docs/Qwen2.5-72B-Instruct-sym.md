## Model Details

This model is an int4 model with group_size 128 and and symmetric quantization of [Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct) generated by [intel/auto-round](https://github.com/intel/auto-round). Load the model with `revision="b7ea233"` to use AutoGPTQ format.
## How To Use

### INT4 Inference(CPU/HPU/CUDA)

CPU requires auto-round version>0.3.1

```python
from auto_round import AutoRoundConfig ##must import for auto-round format
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM,AutoTokenizer
quantized_model_dir = "Intel/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct-int4-inc"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(quantized_model_dir)

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    quantized_model_dir,
    torch_dtype='auto',
    device_map="auto",
    ##revision="b7ea233" ##AutoGPTQ format

text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    tokenize=False,
    add_generation_prompt=True
)
model_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)

generated_ids = model.generate(
    model_inputs.input_ids,
    max_new_tokens=200,  ##change this to align with the official usage
    do_sample=False  ##change this to align with the official usage
)
generated_ids = [
output_ids[len(input_ids):] for input_ids, output_ids in zip(model_inputs.input_ids, generated_ids)
]

response = tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]

prompt = "9.11和9.8哪个数字大"  
#INT4: 
"""要比较9.11和9.8的大小，可以按照以下步骤进行：

1. **比较整数部分**：两个数字的整数部分都是9，所以需要进一步比较小数部分。
2. **比较小数部分**：
   - 9.11的小数部分是0.11
   - 9.8的小数部分是0.8

3. **比较0.11和0.8**：
   - 0.11可以写成0.110
   - 0.8可以写成0.800

4. **逐位比较**：
   - 第一位：1 < 8，所以0.110 < 0.800

因此，9.11 < 9.8。

结论：9.8比9.11大。"""

The people of the kingdom lived happily, tending to their farms, crafting beautiful goods, and enjoying the simple pleasures of life. However, one day, a great darkness began to spread across the land. A wicked sorcerer had risen from the shadows, seeking to claim the throne for himself and plunge the kingdom into chaos.

The king, knowing that he could not face this threat alone, called upon the bravest and most skilled heroes from all corners of the realm. Among them was a young knight named Sir Cedric, who had earned a reputation for his courage and unwavering sense of justice.

### Generate the model

Here is the sample command to generate the model. 

```bash
auto-round \
--model  Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct \
--device 0 \
--group_size 128 \
--nsamples 512 \
--bits 4 \
--iter 1000 \
--disable_eval \
--model_dtype "fp16" \
--format 'auto_gptq,auto_round' \
--output_dir "./tmp_autoround" 
```

## Ethical Considerations and Limitations

The model can produce factually incorrect output, and should not be relied on to produce factually accurate information. Because of the limitations of the pretrained model and the finetuning datasets, it is possible that this model could generate lewd, biased or otherwise offensive outputs.

Therefore, before deploying any applications of the model, developers should perform safety testing.

## Caveats and Recommendations

Users (both direct and downstream) should be made aware of the risks, biases and limitations of the model.
