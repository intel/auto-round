    Args:
        model (`nn.Module`):
            Model to be saved. The model can be wrapped or unwrapped.
        save_dir (`str`):
            Directory to which to save. Will be created if it doesn't exist.
        max_shard_size (`str`, defaults to `"10GB"`):
            The maximum size for a checkpoint before being sharded. Checkpoints shard will then be each of size
            lower than this size. If expressed as a string, needs to be digits followed by a unit (like `"5MB"`).
            <Tip warning={true}>

            If a single weight of the model is bigger than `max_shard_size`, it will be in its own checkpoint shard
            which will be bigger than `max_shard_size`.

            </Tip>
        safe_serialization (`bool`, defaults to `True`):
            Whether to save the model using `safetensors` or the traditional PyTorch way (that uses `pickle`).
